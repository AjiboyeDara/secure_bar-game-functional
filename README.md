This Secure Bar is our customizable health-style progress bar built in Godot, designed to simulate a "security level" interface. It visually responds to events like increases, decreases, and pauses in security status using dynamic colors, styles, and animations. Perfect for our game UI elements for the Cybersecurity Awareness Project.
