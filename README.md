# üîê Secure Bar ‚Äì A Godot UI Component

**Secure Bar** is a dynamic progress bar UI element built with Godot. Inspired by health bars in games, it is repurposed to visualize a ‚Äúsecurity level‚Äù for use in security-themed games or interfaces. The bar can increase, decrease, or pause its level, and changes color to reflect the current status.

## Project Overview

This Godot project includes:

- A `SecureBar` node using `ProgressBar` with custom styles
- Interactive buttons to **Increase**, **Decrease**, and **Pause** the bar
- A `Timer` node to animate changes over time
- Color-coded feedback to indicate levels from safe (blue/green) to critical (red/dark red)
